WGB Pb-PVK PSCs have attracted attention as the top layer of all perovskite-tandem solar cells. Poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine] (PTAA), a conductive polymer, is always used as the hole transporting layer (HTL) for Pb-PVK PSCs. Nevertheless, the hydrophobic surface of the PTAA sometimes destroys the growth of the FA0.8Cs0.2PbI1.8Br1.2 film. On the other hand, the Fermi level of PTAA is not well matched with that of perovskite film. Thus, the PCE of the WBG Pb-based PSCs with PTAA as the HTL was not very high. In this report, the efficiency of the FA0.8Cs0.2PbI1.8Br1.2 is improved by passivating the surface of the PTAA with a monomolecular layer, where the surface becomes hydrophilic, and the band bending of the PTAA layer is improved to cause swift hole collection.

Here, an effective multifunctional additive, benzoyl hydrazine (BH), was developed to modify the perovskite film. The result shows that the defect of the film decreased after BH modification due to the interaction between BH and perovskite. Meanwhile, the I ions (I−) migration is also suppressed due to the weak interaction between BH and perovskite. In addition, the –NH–NH2 in BH can reduce the undesired I2 by reducing it to I−. Finally, the PCE of PSCs modified by BH achieved a PCE of 22.75%, which is one of the highest PCE of the reported MA-free PSCs. The modified device still exhibited excellent stability in different conditions.","tags":["reduce I2","ion migration suppression","defect passivation","weak interaction","benzoyl hydrazine"],"title":"A multifunctional additive strategy to stabilize the precursor solution and passivate film defects for MA-free perovskite solar cells with an efficiency of 22.75%","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huan Bi","Y.

Herein, we report a multifunctional buffer molecule (oteracil potassium, OP) for suppressing hysteresis and passivating defect in stable and efficient methylammonium-free PSC[3]. Experimental and theoretical results prove that multi-functional OP has strong chemical interaction with SnO2 and the perovskite layer. It can not only reduce the oxygen vacancy defects in SnO2 film, but also passivate the under coordinated Pb2+ in perovskite. At the same time, it can significantly inhibit hysteresis. Due to these beneficial effects, the PCE of the OP modified device is over 22%, and the unencapsulated modified device exhibits more excellent humidity stability.

Here, we report a multifunctional interface modification strategy where KPF6 molecule is employed to modify SnO2/perovskite interface. It is revealed that PF6− is still located at interface whereas most of K+ ions diffuse into perovskite layer. PF6− can chemically link SnO2 layer and perovskite layer via the hydrogen bond with perovskites and coordination bond with SnO2, resulting in improved interfacial contact. KPF6 interface modification leads to improved perovskite film quality, interfacial defect passivation, and interfacial stress release. As a result, the KPF6-modified device achieves an efficiency enhancement from 19.66% to 21.39% as compared to the control device. Meanwhile, moisture, thermal and light stability are ameliorated after interface modification. The unencapsulated KPF6-modified device maintains 80.1% of its initial PCE after aging for 960 h at 60 °C and 57.2% after aging for 960 h under one sun illumination, respectively.

Herein, a novel and effective multifunctional modification strategy through incorporating Girard's Reagent T (GRT) molecules with multiple functional groups to modify SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs), which significantly reduces the bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination losses through the simultaneous achievement of suppressing nanoparticle agglomeration, improving the electronic property of SnO2 films, facilitating the vertical growth and enlarging the grain size of perovskite crystals, and passivating interfacial defects is reported.
