The result proves that this chemical interaction can further improve the quality of the perovskite film, thereby reducing the bulk nonradiative recombination of the device and strengthening interface connections. In addition, the reduced interface defects also lead to reduced non-radiative recombination at the interface. Ultimately, single-junction wide bandgap PSCs achieved a high PCE of 16.5%, while device stability improved.

These defect states create imbalance in charge collection at the interfaces, which hinders overall solar cell efficiency. To effectively harness THP’s potential, we introduced a strategic n-type commonly used material, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), as a dopant, which has rarely been discussed. The coupling of PCBM and THP, validated through experimental and density functional theory methods, effectively targeted Sn defect states and transformed the THP semiconducting nature from p-type to intrinsic. Furthermore, strategically positioned PCBM at the grain boundaries offered multiple benefits, including improved adhesion between grains, leading to reduced lattice strain, enhanced energetic matching, and efficient charge transfer. This positing effectively harnessed electron collection due to PCBM’s n-type electronic properties, leading to an enhanced PCE. This blend strategy, broadly followed in organic solar cells, led to the development of PCBM-THP heterojunction solar cells, achieving a record efficiency of 12.68%.","tags":["Defects","Layers","Power conversion efficiency","Recombination","Solar cells"],"title":"Enhanced Electron Transport in Heterojunction Sn-Perovskite Solar Cells Assisted by [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric Acid Methyl Ester as a Dopant","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huan BI (毕欢)"],"categories":["教程"],"content":"首先需要明确的是，我们在数据中所使用的误差线数值应该如何获得。\n目前在数据处理中，国际上尚未统一采用哪一种误差，但是通过谷歌学术初步检索发现，2013年的SCI论文中明确给出误差棒的类型的，其中用平均数±标准误差（S.E.），仅有90条，而用平均数±标准方差（S.D.）约有331条，而对于爱斯维尔系统里的文章，我从我之前看到的论文中统计的结果是有标注误差棒且明确计算方法的，几乎都是用以上两种形式，而每4篇中就有三篇采用的是平均数±标准方差，因此我们在数据处理中的误差线都用平均数±标准方差来获得。\nOrigin如何取平均值和标准差 1、将数据导入。（说明，此处为在条件1下，对同一样品测试4次后得到的数据）\n2、选取需要进行求平均值以及标准差的重复实验数据，选中之后右击Statistics on Row，选择Open Dialog\u0026hellip;，弹出如图的对话框，直接点击OK，就可以在表格中直接得到平均值和标准差数据。（切记，选择时不能选择X轴数据）\n3.误差棒画法参数设置：\n即可得到下图： 数据 序号 数据1 数据2 数据3 数据4 数据5 数据6 数据7 数据8 1 2 1 2.1 2.2 1.9 1.84 0.4827 2 4.1 4.05 3 4.2 3.8 3.83 0.48683 3 7.2 6 7 7.3 6.99 6.898 0.51915 4 13.5 12 13.65 13.57 13.8 13.304 0.73745 5 17.3 17.2 14 16.89 17 16.478 1.3946 6 20.1 20.15 19.89 18 20 19.628 0.91552 7 24.9 25.3 28 25 25.1 25.66 1.31643 8 30.1 31 30.9 30.12 30.14 30.452 0.4562 9 35 34.9 38 35.3 35.2 35.68 1.30652 10 40.2 35 39.8 40.14 40 39.028 2.25697 Did you find this page helpful?

Both experimental and theoretical findings indicate that PEAI not only elevates the perovskite film quality through chemical interactions but also mitigates nonradiative recombination within the device. Consequently, the efficiency of the wide-bandgap (1.77 eV) PSCs based on nickel oxide (NiOx) attained a level of 16.5%. Simultaneously, the all-perovskite tandem solar cells achieved an efficiency of 26.81% and demonstrated superior stability.","tags":["All-perovskite tandem solar cells","Co-modification","Phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI)","Nonradiative recombination","Nickel oxide (NiOx)","Passivation"],"title":"Double side passivation of phenylethyl ammonium iodide for all perovskite tandem solar cell with efficiency of 26.8%","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huan BI (毕欢)","S.

Poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine] (PTAA) and the monomolecular layer called SAM layer are effective hole collection layers for APbI3 PSCs. However, these hole transport layers (HTL) do not give high efficiencies for the wide bandgap FA0.8Cs0.2PbI1.8Br1.2 PSCs. It is found that the surface-modified PTAA by monomolecular layer (MNL) improves the efficiency of PSCs. The improved efficiency is explained by the improved FA0.8Cs0.2PbI1.8Br1.2 film quality, decreased film distortion (low lattice disordering) and low density of the charge recombination site, and improves carrier collection by the surface modified PTAA layer.

Here, an effective multifunctional additive, benzoyl hydrazine (BH), was developed to modify the perovskite film. The result shows that the defect of the film decreased after BH modification due to the interaction between BH and perovskite. Meanwhile, the I ions (I−) migration is also suppressed due to the weak interaction between BH and perovskite. In addition, the –NH–NH2 in BH can reduce the undesired I2 by reducing it to I−. Finally, the PCE of PSCs modified by BH achieved a PCE of 22.75%, which is one of the highest PCE of the reported MA-free PSCs.

Herein, we report a multifunctional buffer molecule (oteracil potassium, OP) for suppressing hysteresis and passivating defect in stable and efficient methylammonium-free PSCs (Rb0.02(FA0.95Cs0.05)0.98PbI2.91Br0.03Cl0.06). Experimental and theoretical results prove that multi-functional OP has strong chemical interaction with SnO2 and the perovskite layer. It can not only reduce the oxygen vacancy defects in SnO2 film but also passivate the under coordinated Pb2+ in perovskite. At the same time, it can significantly inhibit hysteresis. Due to these beneficial effects, the PCE of the OP-modified device is over 22%, and the unencapsulated modified device exhibits more excellent humidity stability. This work provides guidance for the development of multifunctional modified molecules for high PCE, stable, and non-hysteresis PSCs.","tags":["methylammonium-free","perovskite solar cell","interface engineer","low hysteresis","oteracil potassium"],"title":"Highly efficient and low hysteresis methylammonium-free perovskite solar cells based on multifunctional oteracil potassium interface modification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huan BI (毕欢)","B.

Here, we report a multifunctional interface modification strategy where KPF6 molecule is employed to modify SnO2/perovskite interface. It is revealed that PF6− is still located at interface whereas most of K+ ions diffuse into perovskite layer. PF6− can chemically link SnO2 layer and perovskite layer via the hydrogen bond with perovskites and coordination bond with SnO2, resulting in improved interfacial contact. KPF6 interface modification leads to improved perovskite film quality, interfacial defect passivation, and interfacial stress release. As a result, the KPF6-modified device achieves an efficiency enhancement from 19.66% to 21.39% as compared to the control device. Meanwhile, moisture, thermal and light stability are ameliorated after interface modification. The unencapsulated KPF6-modified device maintains 80.1% of its initial PCE after aging for 960 h at 60 °C and 57.2% after aging for 960 h under one sun illumination, respectively. This work provides an idea for developing multifunctional interface molecules toward simultaneously enhancing efficiency and stability of PSCs.","tags":["perovskite solar cells","interface engineering","multifunctional","defect passivation","stress release"],"title":"Interfacial defect passivation and stress release by multifunctional KPF6 modification for planar perovskite solar cells with enhanced efficiency and stability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huan BI (毕欢)"],"categories":["教程"],"content":"引言： 作图的目标在于将数据清晰并准确地传达给读者。 “清晰” 和 “准确” 是必须要达到的。以下以两幅图为例来说明：\n图A和图B在字体和线条上有明显的区别。得益于字体和线条的搭配，图B要更为清晰，能更准确地传达信息。 作图的好坏也取决于 “字体” 和 “线条” 两大要素。 。在文章的出版稿中，图片有些时候只会占据很少的版面，例如，两列中的一列。 因此，如果字体太小，线条过细，那么读者将无法辨析图表中的数据。字体放大，线条加粗则可以有效地规避这个问题。 以下推荐的字体大小和线条粗细之搭配仅供诸位参考学习。\n建议： 作图的准则是 “字不嫌大，线不怕粗” 。\n图的四条边框的粗细建议在 “6” 左右。其它参数设置如图所示。\n横纵坐标的字体建议是 “Times New Roman” ，字体大小是 “37”，加粗。 其他参数设置如图所示。\n坐标轴字体建议 “Times New Roman” ，字体大小是 “57”，加粗。 其他参数设置如图所示。\n数据曲线粗细建议为 “3” ，符号大小为 “13” 。数据名称字体为 “Times New Roman”，字体大小为“23”，加粗。 其他参数设置如图所示。\nDid you find this page helpful?

To date, it is still a huge challenge to minimize the bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination losses, and thus maximize the potentials of PCE and stability. Herein, a novel and effective multifunctional modification strategy through incorporating Girard's Reagent T (GRT) molecules with multiple functional groups to modify SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs), which significantly reduces the bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination losses through the simultaneous achievement of suppressing nanoparticle agglomeration, improving the electronic property of SnO2 films, facilitating the vertical growth and enlarging the grain size of perovskite crystals, and passivating interfacial defects is reported. As a result, the device based on GRT modification delivers a much higher PCE of 21.63%, along with significantly suppressed hysteresis, as compared to the control device (19.77%). The device stability is ameliorated after GRT modification. The unencapsulated device with GRT maintains 99.5% of its initial PCE after aging at 60 °C for 720 h and 58.5% after illumination for 672 h under one sun, respectively.
