abstract  ="A Rb2SO4 additive is employed to passivate the Pb2+ defects in a perovskite film by forming PbSO4in situ{,} which can cover the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite to ensure that the film is not decomposed by moisture. Finally{,} a device based on the Rb2SO4 modification achieved an enhanced power conversion efficiency (22.25%) and long-term stability."}
