abstract = {Abstract Further improvement of the performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is necessary for commercialization. Here, ferrocene derivative dibenzoylferrocene (DBzFe) is used as an additive to enhance the performance and stability of MA- and Br- free PSCs. The results show that the introduction of DBzFe not only passivates the defects in the film but also inhibits the ion migration in the film. The final device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.53\%, which is one of the highest efficiencies currently based on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Moreover, it maintains more than 96.4\% of the original efficiency when running continuously for 400 h at the maximum power point.},
