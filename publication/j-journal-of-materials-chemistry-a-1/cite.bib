abstract  ="Bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination hinder the further enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of SnO2-based planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To date{,} it is still a huge challenge to minimize the bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination losses{,} and thus maximize the potentials of PCE and stability. Herein{,} a novel and effective multifunctional modification strategy through incorporating Girard{'}s Reagent T (GRT) molecules with multiple functional groups to modify SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs){,} which significantly reduces the bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination losses through the simultaneous achievement of suppressing nanoparticle agglomeration{,} improving the electronic property of SnO2 films{,} facilitating the vertical growth and enlarging the grain size of perovskite crystals{,} and passivating interfacial defects is reported. As a result{,} the device based on GRT modification delivers a much higher PCE of 21.63%{,} along with significantly suppressed hysteresis{,} as compared to the control device (19.77%). The device stability is ameliorated after GRT modification. The unencapsulated device with GRT maintains 99.5% of its initial PCE after aging at 60 Â°C for 720 h and 58.5% after illumination for 672 h under one sun{,} respectively. The present work provides guidance for the design of multifunctional modification molecules toward efficient and stable PSCs."}
