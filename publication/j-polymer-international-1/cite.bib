abstract = {Abstract Recently, organometallic halide perovskites have shown attractive application prospects in photoelectric devices depending on their excellent electro-optic properties. However, their poor stability has greatly limited their practical applications. Here, methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr3) crystals are protected by polystyrene (PS) fibre membranes using electrospinning technology. The MAPbBr3@PS composite fibre membranes fabricated in this work not only show strong photoluminescence properties but also excellent stability: 70\% of the fluorescence intensity of MAPbBr3@PS is maintained after soaking in water for 30 days, 85\% after leaving at 95 °C for 350 min, and 90\% after irradiating under UV light for 100 h. The excellent stability of the MAPbBr3@PS fibre membranes may be attributed to the hydrogen bonds between the MAPbBr3 crystal and the PS fibre. In addition, a high-brightness white-light-emitting diode based on MAPbBr3@PS fibre was fabricated, which fully demonstrates its application prospects in the field of colour conversion. © 2020 Society of Industrial Chemistry},
