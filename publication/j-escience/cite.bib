abstract = {This review provides a comprehensive overview of the utilization of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), with a specific focus on their potential as hole transport layers (HTLs). Perovskite materials have garnered significant attention in photovoltaic technology owing to their unique optoelectronic properties. SAMs present a promising solution as efficient and stable HTLs by forming well-ordered thin films on transparent conductive oxide surfaces. This review commences with an introduction to the structure and properties of perovskite materials, followed by a discussion on the operational principles and compositions of functional layers in PSCs. It subsequently delves into the structure, preparation methodologies, and applications of SAMs in PSCs, highlighting their role in enhancing cell efficiency as HTLs. We also discuss their application as electron transport layers. The paper concludes by exploring the potential integration of SAMs into commercial PSC production processes and suggesting future research avenues.}
